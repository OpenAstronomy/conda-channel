# Sample requirements file.

# Each package gets its own section. Hopefully the package you are building
# only needs name and version, but there are several other options.

# - name: ccdproc

  # Version should match the version on PyPI. Versions that could be
  # interpreted as numbers (e.g. 0.1) must be enclosed in quotes.

  # version: '0.3.3' # Required for all packages.

  # # Some packages need extra options passed to setup.py install. This
  # # is the place to provide those options.

  # setup_options: '--offline'   # Defaults to empty if omitted.

  # # If the package contains compiled extensions that link to numpy this
  # # must be set to true to ensure the package is built properly.
  # # If in doubt, set it to true...though it should *always be false*
  # # for a pure python package.

  # numpy_compiled_extensions: false   # Defaults to false if omitted.

  # # Some packages can only be built for specific versions of python but
  # # setup.py often does not contain those restrictions (and conda skeleton
  # # ignores it if present), so list restrictions on python version here.

  # python: '>=2.7|>=3.4'  # if omitted, no restriction on python builds.

  # # Some packages can only be built for certain platforms. List the EXCLUDED
  # # platforms here. Platform names are shown below...note that listing all
  # # platforms would result in no builds!

  # # Default, if omitted, is to build on all platforms listed below.
  # excluded_platforms:
  #   - 'win-64'
  #   - 'linux-64'
  #   - 'osx-64'
